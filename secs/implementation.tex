\section{Implementation}
MAYBE THIS IS WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF M4M THROUGH APP INVENTOR. 


In this section, we detail the implementation of our system. We provide a high level overview of key lessons learned to assist in future research in this direction, but also provide our framework as an open source tool to the research community. We introduce our system within the framework of a three step 'Collect-Merge-Analyze' data lifecycle. This framework is not specifically addressed by literature in the data lifecycle field, but follows a similar pattern and draws inspiration from existing work, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:lifecycle}. For each step of our data lifecycle, we describe the main task, and highlight key challenges presented in interfacing with both continuous and discrete educational data.
